          <p>I just started reading a new Murakami book. Looks good so far.</p>

          <p>Finally we got some snow yesterday and all of it hadn't melted away this 
morning. I took this picture on my morning ride.</p>

          <p>Somehow Chromatics have slipped completely under my radar. I've been
listening to their album Kill for Love all week. Better go record shopping!</p>

<p>One of the local record stores 
<a href="http://www.levykauppax.fi/artist/chromatics/kill_for_love/#2lp">Levykauppa Äx</a> 
described it as "The Cure meets Giorgio Moroder". Not a bad combination.</p>

       <content type="html"><![CDATA[         



                          
          

          <p>These are interesting times for front end development. Google is pushing 
heavily on <a href="http://webcomponents.org/">Web components</a> and Facebook has 
released <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. Google's also got <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">The 
Polymer Project</a> and is backing 
<a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>. Not to mention javascript frameworks 
like <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> and full stack frameworks like 
<a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> or Google's 
<a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>.</p>

<p>I've been wondering where all this comes together. Many of these projects 
have some overlap and it seems that even Google doesn't know where to 
focus.</p>

<p>So what's the future going to look like? I'm not the only one wondering. 
Read this blog post about <a href="http://futurice.com/blog/combining-react-flux-and-web-components">Combining React, Flux &amp; Web 
Components</a> 
by <a href="http://twitter.com/jareware">@jareware</a> for some good thoughts. You 
don't have to choose just one development stack, you can combine React with 
Web components.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm a big fan of React and we're using it for some parts of our 
front end in <a href="https://skillhive.com">Skillhive</a>. We rely heavily on 
<a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> but some of our more complex views are 
starting to look like spaghetti. React has helped a lot to get our front 
end code back in order. It's been easy to replace Backbone Views with React 
components and keep the models and collections intact. This allows us to 
gradully improve our front end code.</p>

<p>It's going to be interesting to see where we're heading! I'm sure component 
reusability in one form or another is going to be the future.</p>

       <content type="html"><![CDATA[         



                          
          

          <p>Posterous has just <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/15/posterous-closing-on-april-30th-to-focus-on-twitter/">announced</a> 
that it will be closed down on 30th of April 2013. This is not a surprise since it 
was acquired by Twitter in 2012.</p>

<p>Two Posterous cofounders have announced their new service called 
<a href="https://posthaven.com/">Posthaven</a>. They have an interesting pledge</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>We'll never be acquired.</li>
  <li>We'll always keep your URL's online.</li>
  <li>We'll always keep it the best place to post.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What's more interesting in Posthaven is their business model.
Sometimes it feels as if startups' goal is to get acquired as fast as possible with as
much money as possible. Posthaven promises that it will never be acquired.</p>

<p>They say that they will also refuse any funding. Of course, they need money to run
the service and they will charge $5/month for running a blog on their site.</p>

<p>It's interesting that lately we've seen an increasing number of web services that charge
money for using their service, like <a href="http://app.net">app.net</a>. I guess a lot of people 
are fed up with advertising or rapidly changing terms of service and are willing to 
pay for good service. And of course you get some peace of mind knowing that the content
you created will always be available to your audience.</p>

<p>Posthaven is not the first blogging platform charging for their services
but it's definitely one of the most interesting ones. I was a big fan of Posterous and
I'm sure I'll keep an eye on Posthaven.</p>

          <p>Wow, this is big news from Lenovo and Google. I like the Chrome OS concept and targetting
these laptops to the educational sector seems like a good idea. iPads in education is
kind of a hot topic at the moment but I'm sure a laptop has its benefits compared to a tablet. 
I guess they still do some writing at schools.</p>

        I finally managed to upgrade my laptop to run Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal. Upgrade went smoothly and everything is working just the way it should be. And yes, the web apps rock.
    </p>

          <h2>Polished UI</h2>

<p>The UI feels a bit more polished compared to 12.04, although, I can't really tell what has changed.</p>

<p>Some of the Compiz desktop effects feel slower when my laptop is connected
to an external display. But when I'm using only my laptop display 
the same effects are faster than in 12.04.</p>

<p>In 12.04 all the effects were consistently
fast both when using only my laptop screen and with an external display attached.
It's a bit strange and I'll have to look into this later on.</p>

<h2>Webapps Rock!</h2>

<p>The biggest thing for me is the web apps. 
I haven't had time to try to write my own web app but I think this is very promising.</p>

<p>Integrating web site notifications with the Unity messaging menu is great. The only
problem, in my opinion, is that you actually have to have the integrated web site open
either in its own tab or in a separate window.</p>

<p>It would be cool if the integration worked
even if the site is not currently open. But this is a good start and I can't wait to
try this out myself!</p>

          <p>I really like these Kisai watches. Usability purists probably hate them but I think the
design is bold and refreshing.</p>

<p>From a usability perspective you should design your application, web site or gadget to
be so easy to use that users don't need a manual to use it. Just take a look at these Kisai
watches, these are something totally different.</p>

<p>The designers at Tokyoflash have taken a completely different approach. 
I think it's amazing that they've been able to completely rethink the design of a traditional 
wrist watch. And you really need a manual to know how to tell the time.</p>

<p>If this isn't thinking otside the box I don't know what is. I'd like to try to design a web site
or an app to be as different as these watches.</p>

          <p>This is a great proposition from Ubuntu. I guess phones already have the processing power to run the full version of Ubuntu
and the possibility to turn your phone into a full desktop is brilliant.</p>

<p>Having the same OS both on your desktop and phone has advantages. Apple has already added some features from iOS to OSX
but they're still very different. Google is doing the same with Chrome OS and Chrome browser.
Ubuntu is taking this one step further by running the exact same OS on both the mobile device and desktop.</p>

<p>I hope this will be a success.</p>

          <p>I think <a href="http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/webapps/">Ubuntu Web Apps</a> is the 
coolest feature of the latest <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/quantal/">Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal)</a>. 
I'm still running
12.04 but this is probably the biggest reason for me to upgrade. I'll try to upgrade during
the Christmas holidays and try developing an app myself.</p>
