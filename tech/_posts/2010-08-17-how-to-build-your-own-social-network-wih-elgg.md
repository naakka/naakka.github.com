Here's a short presentation about Elgg Framework from a technical perspective. 
Elgg is probably the best and easiest solution if you want to build your 
own custom social networking site, whether you're building a private site 
for your organisation or a public community with thousands of users.

From a developer's point of view Elgg is an excellent framework to work with. 
It's easy to extend using the effective plugin system and the Elgg API and 
datamodel make development easy and fast. Personally, I'm a big fan of Elgg 
and I've been working with it since the 1.0 version was released about two years ago.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or want to know more!
Or head on to the [Elgg Community](http://www.elgg.org) for more information.
