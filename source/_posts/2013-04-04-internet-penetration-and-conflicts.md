quote: Clear communication is the most important factor of conflict resolution, no matter how grand or small the problem. The Internet, and perhaps more accurately The Web, is the most powerful mode of communication on Earth. Without it, your worldview is shackled by ignorance, and in our age, there is no room for ignorance.
