Reveal.js is a brilliant way to create stunning presentations using just
CSS and HTML5.

Just take a look at the demo, it's pretty impressive! And it works nicely
with touch screen devices. I'm definitely going to give reveal.js a try
next time I'm giving a presentation somewhere.

ps. this is the first time I tried to embed a reveal.js presentation in an
iframe and it seems to work quite nicely, but it 
[looks a lot better full screen](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)!
