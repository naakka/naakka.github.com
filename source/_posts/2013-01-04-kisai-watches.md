I really like these Kisai watches. Usability purists probably hate them but I think the
design is bold and refreshing. 

From a usability perspective you should design your application, web site or gadget to
be so easy to use that users don't need a manual to use it. Just take a look at these Kisai
watches, these are something totally different. 

The designers at Tokyoflash have taken a completely different approach. 
I think it's amazing that they've been able to completely rethink the design of a traditional 
wrist watch. And you really need a manual to know how to tell the time.

If this isn't thinking otside the box I don't know what is. I'd like to try to design a web site
or an app to be as different as these watches.
