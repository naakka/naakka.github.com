This is a great proposition from Ubuntu. I guess phones already have the processing power to run the full version of Ubuntu
and the possibility to turn your phone into a full desktop is brilliant.

Having the same OS both on your desktop and phone has advantages. Apple has already added some features from iOS to OSX
but they're still very different. Google is doing the same with Chrome OS and Chrome browser.
Ubuntu is taking this one step further by running the exact same OS on both the mobile device and desktop.

I hope this will be a success.
