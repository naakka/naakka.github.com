##Polished UI

The UI feels a bit more polished compared to 12.04, although, I can't really tell what has changed.

Some of the Compiz desktop effects feel slower when my laptop is connected
to an external display. But when I'm using only my laptop display 
the same effects are faster than in 12.04. 

In 12.04 all the effects were consistently
fast both when using only my laptop screen and with an external display attached.
It's a bit strange and I'll have to look into this later on.

##Webapps Rock!

The biggest thing for me is the web apps. 
I haven't had time to try to write my own web app but I think this is very promising.

Integrating web site notifications with the Unity messaging menu is great. The only
problem, in my opinion, is that you actually have to have the integrated web site open
either in its own tab or in a separate window. 

It would be cool if the integration worked
even if the site is not currently open. But this is a good start and I can't wait to
try this out myself!
