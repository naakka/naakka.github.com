Wow, this is big news from Lenovo and Google. I like the Chrome OS concept and targetting
these laptops to the educational sector seems like a good idea. iPads in education is
kind of a hot topic at the moment but I'm sure a laptop has its benefits compared to a tablet. 
I guess they still do some writing at schools.
