Posterous has just [announced](http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/15/posterous-closing-on-april-30th-to-focus-on-twitter/) 
that it will be closed down on 30th of April 2013. This is not a surprise since it 
was acquired by Twitter in 2012. 

Two Posterous cofounders have announced their new service called 
[Posthaven](https://posthaven.com/). They have an interesting pledge

> - We'll never be acquired.
> - We'll always keep your URL's online.
> - We'll always keep it the best place to post.

What's more interesting in Posthaven is their business model.
Sometimes it feels as if startups' goal is to get acquired as fast as possible with as
much money as possible. Posthaven promises that it will never be acquired. 

They say that they will also refuse any funding. Of course, they need money to run
the service and they will charge $5/month for running a blog on their site.

It's interesting that lately we've seen an increasing number of web services that charge
money for using their service, like [app.net](http://app.net). I guess a lot of people 
are fed up with advertising or rapidly changing terms of service and are willing to 
pay for good service. And of course you get some peace of mind knowing that the content
you created will always be available to your audience.

Posthaven is not the first blogging platform charging for their services
but it's definitely one of the most interesting ones. I was a big fan of Posterous and
I'm sure I'll keep an eye on Posthaven.
