I think [Ubuntu Web Apps](http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/webapps/) is the 
coolest feature of the latest [Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/quantal/). 
I'm still running
12.04 but this is probably the biggest reason for me to upgrade. I'll try to upgrade during
the Christmas holidays and try developing an app myself.
