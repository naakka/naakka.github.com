## Lets start

Just playing around with Markup. Lets try some code in here, mkay.

## Here's some fancy code for you

> Code is great in blockquoes.

* Yeah
* Jeah
* Joo!

### A PHP Example

{% highlight php %}
<?php
echo "Hello world!";

class TestClass 
{
	public function __construct() 
	{
		echo "Jeah!";
	}
}

?>
{% endhighlight %}

I think there's even an inline code possibility: `print_r($array);`
