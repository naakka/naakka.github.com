description: Apps are the biggest thing in Sharepoint 2013. It's possible to create Sharepoint apps in just HTML, CSS and JavaScript and even host them on your own server. I have just taken my first steps in developing apps for Sharepoint 2013 and hosting them on a LAMP server. These are my first impressions of the development process.

## A New World

Sharepoint 2013 seems to be all about the apps.

I guess Microsoft has watched what kind of an ecosystem Facebook has built with
their apps and wanted to something similar with Sharepoint. It's a great idea and
it's quite promising. 
 

## Poor Documentation

The documentation and tutorials on the Microsoft site are very poor to say the least.
Even many open source projects win Microsoft in this regards. Just tak a look at
[Symfony](http://www.symfony.com), for instance. I hope this is something that Microsoft
will work on.

The quality of the tutorials is quite poor as well. Just take a look at this tutorial.

Yes, you got that right. Using tables for a web page layout in 2013. I know it's just an example
but it doesn't give a very good first impression. If the rest of Sharepoint 2013
is filled with this kind of HTML I would be worried. That was how web sites were made 
15 years ago, it was probably still acceptable 10 years ago but definitely no in 2013. 

If you think developing Sharepoint apps will be as easy as creating Facebook apps,
sorry to disappoint you. At least at the moment documentation and the lack of proper
tutorials and working examples is the biggest obstacle in apps development. If you've
ever developed any Facebook apps, you already know how easy it is. Anyone with a little
knowledge in PHP can write a Facebook app easily. Creating Sharepoint apps should be
just as easy.



## It's Microsoft

Microsoft is pretty proud that it's possible to develop apps for Sharepoint 2013 using
non-microsoft technologies like plain old HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sadly, this doesn't
quite work as advertised and it seems that for plenty of things you need to do development
using Microsoft Visual Studio which, of course, requires you to run Windows.


## Final Thoughts

Apps for Sharepoint 2013 are promising and I think this is definitely a step in the 
right direction by Microsoft. But at least at the moment getting started in development
is unnecessarily difficult if you don't have any prior development experience in the
Microsoft ecosystem.  

My biggest complaint is the poor quality and the lack of documentation. But I'm sure
this is something Microsoft will work on before the launch. 

Microsoft seems to
be pretty proud that it's possible to develop apps even if you're not familiar with
Microsoft tools. Sadly, this is not quite true and it seems that for a lot of tasks
you need Microsoft Visual Studio for development and that of course requires you
to run Windows. This is a show stopper for many developers using Mac or Linux. 
If Microsoft wants to attract developers using non-microsoft tools this is something
that they really need to get fixed.
