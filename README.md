# My Personal Blog

This is my personal blog hosted using Github Pages with a custom domain 
([naakka.net](http://naakka.net)). 

## Technical details

The blog is created using [Sculpin](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). 
I've setup posts in two different categories, tech and photos. I wanted
the category listings to have pagination, and for that I'm using 
[category pagination plugin](https://github.com/MrWerewolf/jekyll-category-pagination) by 
[MrWerewolf](https://github.com/MrWerewolf). 

Understandably, Github doesn't allow you to use plugins with Jekyll and
that's why I create the HTML locally and push the static html files to the
master branch. 

For the front end I used [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and
[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) for the icons.
